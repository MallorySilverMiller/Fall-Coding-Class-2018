# Write a Python program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of n+nn+nnn

# Write your pseudocode here
# ask for input
# get n from input
# compute nn
# compute nnn
# print n, nn, and nnn added together

# Write your code here
n = int(input(""))
nn = n * n
nnn = n * n * n
print(n + nn + nnn)
